Traffic Analysis Without Administrative Access: A Comprehensive
Guide</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>As a pentester, you encounter various challenges during different
types of assessments. Most of the time, you work remotely, but sometimes
you need to conduct on-site assessments that require analyzing
client-server communication of specific software applications. </p>
<p>A common obstacle is that customers are not really eager to grant administrative
rights on the hosts where target applications are installed, preventing
you from installing essential tools like Wireshark to perform network
traffic analysis. In some cases, it is even not possible because of the
internal policies, so you need to think creatively about how to bypass
such restrictions and perform a penetration test to the full extent
required by your contract.</p>
<p>In this blog article, we explore three practical methods for
conducting network sniffing even when you don’t have administrative
control over the target host, enabling you to fulfill your testing
objectives without compromising security policies.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>
<p>When faced with restricted access scenarios, you might consider these
problematic approaches:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Pressuring the system administrator for
administrative rights: Just kidding. Simply don’t do it. This approach
can damage client relationships and is unprofessional.</li>
<li>Escalating privileges through vulnerability exploitation: While privilege
escalation is part of penetration testing, modern systems have
significantly reduced attack surfaces (the days when SeImpersonate
privilege was granted to almost any account are long gone).</li>
</ol>
<p>Fortunately, there are legitimate alternatives that don’t require
administrative access on the target system.</p>
<h3 id="solution-1-bridged-network-interfaces">Solution 1: Bridged
Network Interfaces</h3>
<h4 id="required-equipment">Required Equipment</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>USB Ethernet adapters</strong>: Portable network interfaces
for your laptop (at least one should be already provided on your laptop,
otherwise two adapters).</li>

<li><strong>Ethernet cables</strong>: Usually available on-site, but
just in case.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Network Setup Architecture</h4>
The concept involves transforming your pentesting laptop into a network bridge that
intercepts all traffic from the client.
<pre><code>        USB Ethernet 1 (eth1) -&gt; Ethernet cable -&gt; Switch/Router
        /
Pentester PC (Wireshark)
        \
        USB Ethernet 2 (eth2) -&gt; Ethernet cable -&gt; Client </code></pre>
<p class="caption"><em>Bridged interface network topology: the pentesting laptop with
two USB Ethernet adapters connected to it. One is connected to the
switch or router, the other one - to the client.</em> 
<h4 id="innstallation-and-configuration">Installation and Configuration</h4>
<p>First, install the bridge utilities package (not provided by default
on Kali Linux):</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install bridge-utils</code></pre>
<p class="caption"><em>Code Snippet 1: Installing bridge utilities package</em></p>
<p>Next, configure the bridged interface with the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>
# Take down both network interfaces
ifconfig eth1 down
ifconfig eth2 down

# Create a new bridge interface
brctl addbr br0

# Add both ethernet interfaces to the bridge
brctl addif br0 eth1
brctl addif br0 eth2

# Bring up all interfaces
ifconfig eth1 up
ifconfig eth2 up
ifconfig br0 up 

# Obtain IP address via DHCP
dhclient br0</code></pre>
<p class="caption"><em>Code Snippet 2: Bridge interface configuration commands</em></p>
<p>Once configured, your bridge interface will automatically obtain an
IP address, and the client’s Ethernet interface will establish
connectivity through your laptop. At this point, launch Wireshark and
monitor the <strong>br0</strong> interface to capture all traffic
flowing between the client and the network.</p>
<h3 id="solution-2-wireless-access-point-hotspot">Solution 2: Wireless
Access Point (Hotspot)</h3>
<h4 id="use-case">Use Case</h4>
<p>This method is ideal when the target device lacks Ethernet
connectivity and relies solely on wireless connection. </p>
<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Main network interface</strong>: for internet
connectivity (assumed as eth1)</li>
<li><strong>Wireless interface</strong>:
for creating the access point (assumed as wlan0)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="configuration-steps">Configuration Steps</h4>
Wireless Interface Setup Assign a unique IP to your wireless
adapter:
<pre><code>sudo ip addr add 10.0.0.1/24 dev wlan0</code></pre>
<p class="caption"><em>Code Snippet 3: Configuring wireless adapter IP address</em></p>
DHCP Service Configuration Edit the dnsmasq configuration file
(/etc/dnsmasq.conf):
<pre><code>
domain-needed
bogus-priv
no-resolv
filterwin2k
expand-hosts
domain=localdomain
local=/localdomain/
listen-address=10.0.0.1
dhcp-range=10.0.0.100,10.0.0.199,12h
dhcp-lease-max=100
dcp-option=option:router,10.0.0.1
dhcp-authoritative
server=8.8.8.8
server=8.8.4.4</code></pre>
<p class="caption"><em>Code Snippet 4: dnsmasq configuration for DHCP services</em></p>
<p>Start the DHCP server:</p>
<pre><code>sudo dnsmasq -C /etc/dnsmasq.conf</code></pre>
<p class="caption"><em>Code Snippet 5: Starting the DHCP server</em></p>
<h4>Access Point Configuration</h4>
Create the hostapd configurationfile:
<pre><code>touch /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf</code></pre>
<p>Configure the access point parameters:</p>
<pre><code>interface=wlan0
ssid=MYAP
channel=11
hw_mode=g
ieee80211n=1
wpa=2
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
rsn_pairwise=CCMP
wpa_passphrase=MyS3CuR3Passw0rd!</code></pre>
<p class="caption"><em>Code Snippet 6: hostapd configuration for wireless access
point</em> Launch the access point:</p>
<pre><code>sudo hostapd hostapd.conf</code></pre>
<p class="caption"><em>Code Snippet 7: Starting hostapd service</em></p>
<h4>Network Forwarding and NAT Configuration</h4>
<p>Enable IP forwarding:</p>
<pre><code>sudo echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</code></pre>
<p class="caption"><em>Code Snippet 8: Enabling IP forwarding</em></p>
<p>Configure NAT using iptables:</p>
<pre><code>sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -s 10.0.0.0/24 -j MASQUERADE</code></pre>
<p class="caption"><em>Code Snippet 9: Configuring NAT for internet access</em> </p>
<p>Additional Forwarding Rules: In some cases, you may need explicit forwarding rules:</p>
<pre><code>
iptables -A FORWARD -i wlan0 -o eth1 -s 10.0.0.0/24 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -o wlan0 -d 10.0.0.0/24 -j ACCEPT</code></pre>
<p class="caption"><em>Code Snippet 10: Additional forwarding rules for traffic
routing</em></p> 
<p>Verify your configuration:</p>
<pre><code>
sudo iptables -L 
sudo iptables -t nat -L</code></pre>
<p class="caption"><em>Code Snippet 11: Verifying NAT configuration</em> After
completing the setup, test the access point by connecting a device and
verifying internet connectivity. Once confirmed, start Wireshark on the
<strong>wlan0</strong> interface to capture client traffic.</p>
<h3 id="solution-3-managed-switch-port-mirroring">Solution 3: Managed
Switch Port Mirroring</h3>
<h4 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h4>
<p>This method requires cooperating with the system administrator as
they should adjust a configuration on the <strong>managed</strong>
network switch that supports port mirroring functionality.</p>
<h4 id="configuration-scheme">Configuration Scheme</h4>
<pre><code>                 / -&gt; port 2 (mirroring port) -&gt; Pentest laptop
router -&gt; switch 
                 \ -&gt; port 3 (mirrored port) -&gt; Client to be analyzed</code></pre>
<p class="caption"><em>Port mirroring setup: Traffic from the client port is mirrored to
the monitoring port</em></p>
<h4 id="configuration-process">Configuration Process</h4>
<p>Request the system administrator to configure port mirroring on an
available switch port, whereby the target client is connected on the
source/mirrored port, and your pentesting laptop is connected on the
destination/mirroring port. 
<h4>Switch Configuration Example</h4> 
The following example demonstrates configuration on a TP-Link TL-SG105E
managed switch:</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="./img/002-port-mirroring-1.png"
alt="TL-SG105E Config Page" /> <em>TP-LINK Web Interface: port mirroring
configuration showing the setup for duplicating traffic from port 3
(client) to port 2 (pentester laptop)</em></p>
<p>Once the switch configuration is active, launch Wireshark. You will
capture all traffic flowing through the mirrored port.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>These three methods provide practical solutions for conducting
network traffic analysis during penetration tests when administrative
access is restricted. Each approach offers distinct advantages:
<ul>
<li><strong>Bridged interfaces</strong>: Ideal for wired connections</li>
<li><strong>Wireless access point</strong>: Perfect for WiFi-only devices</li>
<li><strong>Port mirroring</strong>: Requires managed switch</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to always coordinate with system administrators and document
your testing methodology to ensure transparency and maintain trust
throughout the engagement.</p>
